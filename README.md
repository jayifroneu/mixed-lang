# mixed-lang
A model of simple programming language that allows for classes and gradual typing.

## Motivation
Mixed was an exercise in
1. ...understanding the tradeoffs that PL designers make when they decide the syntax and semantics of their languages. In context, these choices define the *pragmatics* of their language. Each decision can be understood on matrix with **costs** and **benefits** on one axis and **developers** and **language designers** on the other.
2. ...implementing a model of prospective language that used a CESK runtime. A CESK machine is common way to model a language's semantics without also designing and implementing a full compiler (the machine effectively fulfills the role of an interpreter), and understanding how to construct one is a critical skill for any student interested in the study of programming languages.
